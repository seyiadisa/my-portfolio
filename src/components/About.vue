        I help businesses design and build intelligent software that scales and drives growth. From
        modern APIs to AI-powered interfaces, I turn complex ideas into reliable products that
        perform in the real world, and continue to do so as your users and revenue grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on outcomes, not just implementation. I think in terms of systems, trade-offs,
        and long-term value: clean architecture, fast user experiences, and technology decisions
        that reduce risk while unlocking new opportunities. The goal is always to ship products that
        are easy to extend, hard to break, and aligned with business objectives.

        When I&apos;m not building, I&apos;m reading or playing the keyboard, or just listening to a
        lot of music.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you&apos;re building a product meant to scale revenue, not technical debt, I&apos;m
        someone you want on your side.
